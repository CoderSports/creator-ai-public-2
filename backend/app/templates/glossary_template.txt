# Glossary for {project_title} - {complexity} Project

This glossary explains the key programming terms used in the {project_title} project. Each term is defined in a way that helps students aged 8-16 understand core programming concepts. Where possible, analogies and real-world examples are provided to relate these concepts to everyday situations.

## Glossary Terms

### Term 1: Function
**Definition**: A function is a reusable block of code that performs a specific task. In {project_title}, you will write functions to calculate important values like the area of a circle. Just like following a recipe, you provide inputs, and the function returns an output.

- **Example**:
```python
def greet(name):
    return f"Hello, {name}!"
```

- **Link to Previous Terms**: A function uses variables as its ingredients to create outputs, just like how a recipe uses ingredients to make food.

- **Real-World Connection**: Functions are like following instructions in the kitchen to bake a cake.

### Term 2: Variable
**Definition**: A variable is like a storage box in programming. In {project_title}, you will use variables to store player scores, object positions, and more. The value of a variable can change while the program runs.

- **Example**:
```python
player_score = 0
```

- **Link to Previous Terms**: Just like ingredients in a recipe can change, a variable’s value can change while your program runs.

- **Real-World Connection**: Variables are like containers where you store ingredients that you might use in different parts of a recipe.

### Term 3: Loop
**Definition**: A loop allows you to repeat a block of code until a condition is met. In {project_title}, you will use loops to move through different levels or repeat tasks automatically.

- **Example**:
```python
for i in range(3):
    print("This will print three times.")
```

- **Link to Previous Terms**: Loops often work with variables to track how many times something repeats.

- **Real-World Connection**: Loops are like setting an alarm to go off every hour—it repeats based on a set condition.

(Add more terms as needed for the lesson.)

### Key Features:
1. **Real-world connections**: Every definition is linked to relatable real-world examples, which is especially useful for younger learners.
2. **Examples and Context**: Code examples accompany each term, providing clear, actionable demonstrations of concepts.
3. **Link to Other Terms**: The glossary helps students see how different programming concepts are interconnected.
