Title: {project_title}
Complexity: {complexity}

This file contains hidden support functions for the {project_title} project.
These functions are intentionally hidden from the students to prevent overwhelming them with complexity.
They serve as a foundational layer for more advanced concepts that will be introduced gradually
as students progress through the lesson phases.

The hidden code demonstrates best practices in modularity, error handling, and advanced logic.
It will be uncovered in later lessons when students are better equipped to understand the inner workings.
