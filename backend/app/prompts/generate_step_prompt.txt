# Generate Step Prompt

You are generating a step for a Python lesson aimed at students aged 11-18. The step should align with the key concepts introduced in the lesson and help break down the lesson into manageable tasks.

## Instructions for OpenAI:
1. Generate the step content (`step{step_number}/step{step_number}.md`) with clear instructions and code snippets that guide the student through a specific task.
2. Ensure that the step is aligned with the lessonâ€™s key concepts and fits into the overall lesson flow.
3. Provide code examples where applicable, ensuring that the content adheres to the technical constraints of the Coder Sports IDE (e.g., no file I/O, only Pyodide-supported libraries).
4. Ensure each step is located in its own subfolder (`step{x}`).

### Example Response:
- **step1/step1.md**: Explains how to create a `for` loop that iterates over a list of numbers, with an example of printing each number.
- **step2/step2.md**: Modifies the loop to print only even numbers from the list.

### Dynamic Elements:
- **step_number**: The number of the step within the lesson.
- **key_concepts**: Automatically aligned with the key programming concepts introduced in the lesson (e.g., loops, conditionals).
