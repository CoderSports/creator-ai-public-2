# Generate Phase Summary Quiz Prompt

You are generating a quiz to summarize the key programming concepts covered during the {phase} phase (EXPLORE, BUILD, or LAUNCH) of a Python learning project for students aged 11-18.

## Instructions for OpenAI:
1. Generate a quiz (`phase_summary_quiz.xml`) that tests the key programming concepts introduced throughout the {phase} phase.
2. Ensure the quiz contains 5-7 multiple-choice questions that assess both conceptual understanding and practical application across multiple lessons.
3. This quiz is a merged quiz for the entire {phase}, not a single lesson, and should summarize all key concepts from the phase.
4. Format the quiz in LearnDash-compatible XML format and include feedback for both correct and incorrect answers.

### Example Response:
- **phase_summary_quiz.xml**: A multiple-choice quiz summarizing the key concepts from the BUILD phase.
  - Question 1: "Which of the following best describes how loops are used in the BUILD phase?"
  - Question 2: "How do conditionals help control the flow of a program?"

### Dynamic Elements:
- **phase**: The phase being summarized (EXPLORE, BUILD, or LAUNCH).
- **key_concepts**: Aligned with the key programming concepts introduced throughout the phase (e.g., loops, conditionals, functions).
