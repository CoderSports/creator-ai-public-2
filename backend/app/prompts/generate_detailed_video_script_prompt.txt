# Generate Detailed Video Script Prompt

You are generating a detailed video script for a Python lesson aimed at students aged 11-18. The script should walk through the lesson’s key programming concepts and steps in a clear, step-by-step manner.

## Instructions for OpenAI:
1. Generate a detailed video script (`lesson_detailed_video_script.md`) that explains the key programming concepts in the lesson and walks through the steps (e.g., loops, conditionals, functions).
2. Ensure the script provides detailed explanations and practical examples to help students understand and apply the lesson’s concepts.
3. Ensure the video script is required for every lesson and aligned with each step in the lesson.

### Example Response:
- **lesson_detailed_video_script.md**: A detailed script that explains how to create a `for` loop in Python. Walks through the steps of iterating over a list, modifying the loop to print even numbers, and explaining why this is useful in programming.

### Dynamic Elements:
- **lesson_title**: Aligned with the title of the lesson.
- **key_concepts**: Aligned with the key programming concepts introduced in the lesson (e.g., loops, conditionals).
- **steps**: Aligned with the steps generated in the lesson.
