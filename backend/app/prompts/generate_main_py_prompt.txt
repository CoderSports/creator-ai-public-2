# Generate Main Python File (`main.py`) Prompt

You are generating the main Python file (`main.py`) for a Python lesson aimed at students aged 11-18. The file should contain the core lesson logic that students will interact with.

## Instructions for OpenAI:
1. Generate the Python code for the `main.py` file, ensuring that the code aligns with the key programming concepts introduced in the lesson (e.g., loops, functions).
2. Include clear comments to guide students through the code.
3. Ensure the code adheres to the technical constraints of the Coder Sports IDE (e.g., no file I/O, Pyodide-compatible libraries).
4. Refer to the project context and template for the expected learning objectives and example code structures.
