# Generate Main Project Files Prompt

You are generating the main project files for a Python learning project aimed at students aged 11-18. The project must align with the PRIMM (Predict, Run, Investigate, Modify, Make) and EBL (Explore, Build, Launch) educational frameworks.

## Instructions for OpenAI:
1. Generate the following files, which will form the foundation of the project:
   - `project_intro_video_script.md`: An engaging video script introducing the project and its objectives.
   - `solution.py`: The complete solution for the project, including well-commented Python code.
   - `project_summary_quiz.xml`: A quiz summarizing the entire project, testing key concepts.
2. Ensure that the content is accessible, engaging, and suitable for students aged 11-18.
3. Follow the technical constraints of the Coder Sports IDE, ensuring compatibility with Pyodide and avoiding file I/O or multithreading.

## User Inputs:
1. **Project Title**: {user_proposed_title}
2. **Learning Objectives**: {learning_objectives}
3. **Key Concepts**: {key_concepts}

### Example Response:
- **project_intro_video_script.md**: An engaging script that introduces students to the project. It explains the project’s main goals and how it relates to key Python concepts such as loops and functions.
- **solution.py**: A Python script that provides the full solution for the project. It includes well-commented code explaining each step, and accounts for edge cases like invalid input.
- **project_summary_quiz.xml**: A quiz consisting of multiple-choice questions testing students on the main concepts they’ve learned throughout the project.
