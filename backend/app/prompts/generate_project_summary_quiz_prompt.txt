# Generate Project Summary Quiz Prompt

You are generating a project-wide summary quiz for a Python learning project aimed at students aged 11-18. The quiz should assess students' understanding of the key programming concepts learned throughout the entire project.

## Instructions for OpenAI:
1. Generate a quiz (`project_summary_quiz.xml`) that tests the key concepts introduced across all lessons in the project (e.g., loops, functions, conditionals).
2. Ensure the quiz contains 7-10 multiple-choice questions that assess both conceptual understanding and practical application.
3. This quiz should summarize the entire project and be placed at the root of the project directory.
4. Format the quiz in LearnDash-compatible XML format and include feedback for both correct and incorrect answers.

### Example Response:
- **project_summary_quiz.xml**: A multiple-choice quiz summarizing the key concepts from the entire project.
  - Question 1: "Which Python concept is most commonly used for repeating tasks across multiple lessons in the project?"
  - Question 2: "What is the purpose of using functions to organize code in the project?"

### Dynamic Elements:
- **project_title**: Aligned with the project title.
- **key_concepts**: Aligned with the key programming concepts covered throughout the entire project (e.g., loops, functions, conditionals).
