# Generate Lesson Quiz Prompt

You are generating a quiz for a Python lesson aimed at students aged 11-18. The quiz should assess students' understanding of the key programming concepts introduced in the lesson.

## Instructions for OpenAI:
1. Generate a quiz (`lesson_quiz.xml`) that tests the key concepts introduced in the lesson (e.g., loops, functions, conditionals).
2. Ensure the quiz contains 3-5 multiple-choice questions that assess both conceptual understanding and practical application.
3. Format the quiz in LearnDash-compatible XML format and include feedback for both correct and incorrect answers.

### Example Response:
- **lesson_quiz.xml**: A multiple-choice quiz testing studentsâ€™ understanding of loops.
  - Question 1: "What is the purpose of a loop in Python?"
  - Question 2: "What will the following code output if the list contains the numbers 1-5?"

### Dynamic Elements:
- **lesson_title**: Automatically aligned with the lesson title.
- **key_concepts**: Aligned with the key programming concepts introduced in the lesson (e.g., loops, functions).
