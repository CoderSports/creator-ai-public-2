# Project File Structure Prompt

You are generating the file structure for a Python learning project aimed at students aged 11-18. The project must align with the PRIMM and EBL educational frameworks.

## Instructions for OpenAI:
1. Generate a file structure that includes the main project folder, with subfolders for the phases (EXPLORE, BUILD, LAUNCH), and files for each lesson, Python files, support files, quizzes, and a course-level image.
2. Ensure that the file structure includes:
   - **Main Course Files**: Including the `course_intro_video_script.md`, `course_overview.md`, `course_learning_objectives.md`, `course_summary_quiz.xml`, and **course_image.webp**.
   - **EXPLORE/BUILD/LAUNCH Phase Subfolders**: Each phase contains its own lessons with the following files:
     - **Lesson Content** (`lesson.md`)
     - **Steps** (`step{x}/step{x}.md`) — Each step should be in its own subfolder.
     - **Quizzes**:
       - `quiz.xml` (Lesson-specific quiz)
       - Phase-level `quiz.xml` (merged quiz for the entire phase)
     - **Python Files** (`main.py`, `hidden.py`, `solution.py`)
     - **Video Scripts** (`lesson_intro_video_script.md`, `lesson_detailed_video_script.md`) — Required for each lesson.
     - **Support Files** (`hints.md`, `glossary.md`)
     - **Images** (`lesson_image.webp`) — Required for each lesson.
3. Return the structure in a clear format, outlining the lessons and steps for each phase.
